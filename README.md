<h1> Wiki Data Webscraper </h1>

<h2> Overview </h2>

The project is the implementation of webscraping on Wiki Fandom website.

<h2> Motivation </h2>

Webscraper aims to utilize handful of Python tools and libraries to scrape data. The program can scroll through and download all valuable information, then store them into pandas dataframe (keywords, links, categories, statistics) and separate dedidacted folder (images).

<h2> Features </h2>

1. Selenium Webdriver (optional, needless for correct execution).
2. Website Crawler - a program that searches for crucial tags and fetches them.
3. Numpy data representation - every instance is stored in separate NParray.
4. Data framing - native Pandas DataFrame composition of gathered data.
5. Image downloader - snatches pictures on the website and stores their buffer representation in dedicated folder.

2. Install necessary packages  - pip install bs4 numpy pygame helper matplotlib collections -
3. Download the project and open it in the IDE
4. Move to the last cell and select option "Execute above cells" then execute the last cell separately.
